# DES-SimpleQueues
Assignment 2 Stochastic Simulation

The notebook DES_v1.ipynb computes the average waiting time for various queue types as function of the server load.
In the section #global variables, all the variables that are needed for the simulation are defined as well as the number of samples per run.

The remaining part of the code simulates the queue, computes the average waiting time for different server loads, checks if the batch means are normally distributed and finally plots the results
